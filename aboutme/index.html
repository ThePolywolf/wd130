    <p>
        Hello all, my name is Dallin Wolfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon and love the rain a lot. 
        I am currently working on my Computer Sceince degree, and will graduate at the end of next year. 
        I have no idea what I want to do as a job yet. 
        I <strong>ABSOLUTELY LOVE</strong> MMA. 
        My martial art set is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and Boxing. 
        I also love to cook and play the piano. 
        I am not married and have no kids. 
        I currently an unemployed, but am working with a friend on a Web Scraping project we hope to eventually sell licenses to it. 
        BYU-I is a pretty good school, but there's nothing here I absolutely love. 
        I am working on my Bachelors at the moment, but plan to get a Masters or higher afterwards.

        I believe learning web development is important since even if you aren't headed into a Web Development career, it is useful to learn how they work to be able to write code that interfaces or interacts with HTML in some way. 
        I'm taking this course since I want to make sure I understand the fundamentals of web development.
        I have been a life-long member of the Church.

    <p>
        I look forward to taking this class with you all!
