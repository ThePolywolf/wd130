                <h2>Vettori VS Allen</h2>
                <h3>April 6th, Italy vs. United States</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>This is a matchup of two highly skilled and equally paired fighters. You don't want to miss this match. While this isn't the most monumental of matchups, it will be among the most entertaining fights this season.</p>

            <div class="fight-card middle-card">
                <h2>Perriera VS Hill</h2>
                <h3>April 13th, Brazil (-155) vs. United States (+130)</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>Periera is defending his title in this fight, however the odds are not in his favor. This will be a very technical matchup for the true MMA enthusiasts that you simply can't miss. Hill is likely to claim this title, however it is far from an easy fight for him.</p>

                <h3>April 13th, China vs. China</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>These two female fighters will be a brutal match for both of them. Weili is one of the top fighters this season, and is likely to successfully defend her title in this matchup. Her fights are a must watch, and this one is no exception.</p>
